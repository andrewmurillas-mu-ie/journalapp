        <h2>Ireland's Natural Heritage</h2>
        <p>
          Ireland's landscape is a tapestry of stunning natural wonders, shaped
          by millions of years of geological processes and blessed with a unique
          climate that creates its characteristic emerald green vegetation. From
          the wild Atlantic coastline to the gentle eastern shores, from
          towering mountains to serene lakes, the country offers an incredible
          diversity of natural landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our interactive gallery showcases the best of Irish nature across four
          main categories: mountains that touch the clouds, ancient forests that
          whisper tales of the past, lakes that mirror the sky, and rivers that
          carved the land through millennia.
